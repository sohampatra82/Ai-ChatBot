The function you've written will execute `1 + 2` but won't *return* the result. In JavaScript, if you want a function to
produce a value, you need to use the `return` keyword.

Here's the corrected version:

```javascript
function sum() {
return (1 + 2); // The 'return' keyword sends the result back
}

// How to use it:
let result = sum();
console.log(result); // This will output 3
```

**Explanation of the fix:**

* **`return (1 + 2);`**: Without `return`, the function calculates `1 + 2` (which is `3`), but then that value is simply
discarded. The function would implicitly return `undefined`. By adding `return`, you specify that `3` should be the
value that the `sum()` call evaluates to.

**Alternative (more concise for simple functions, using an arrow function):**

For very simple functions that just return a single expression, you can use an arrow function with an implicit return:

```javascript
const sum = () => 1 + 2;

let result = sum();
console.log(result); // This will also output 3
```
